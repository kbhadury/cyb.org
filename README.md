### Unfortunately my hilarious domain name has expired (I bought the domain for a year using free credits at HackDavis and didn't want to spend any actual money to renew it)
### You can still take the test at https://kbhadury.github.io/cyb.org/
Are you unusually good with computers? :computer: 

Do you forgo redwoods and pines for binary trees? :evergreen_tree: :evergreen_tree: :evergreen_tree:

Do you feel a strong connection to Westworld? :train: :horse: :cactus:

Then you might be a cyborg!  And with this super quick quiz, you'll find out for sure.  Give it a try: if you score 7 or higher, you're probably a robot!
_If you already know you're a robot and score less than 4, you might want to download a few updates_.
